| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bobbins | Tools for keeping thread organised. Often made from card or plastic, thread can be wrapped around them for storage purposes. |
| Frog/frogging | The act of removing incorrect stitches. This term comes from the idea that to rip stitches consecutively sounds like a frog. _"Rip it, rip it, rip it..._ |
| Thread chicken | This is a game a lot of stitchers play to complete as many stitches as possible before running out of thread. They may share the small cut offs of thread on social media to declare their victory. |
| WIP | Work in progress. Refers to an as yet incomplete piece. Stitchers usually share pictures of their ongoing pieces in a daily event called "WIP Wednesday".
